**Page 4: Existing System:-**

- Existing system is based on manual work and all the gym management tasks are done manually, so they maintain registers and notebooks for recording all the details of the system.
- Gyms currently operate using a combination of:
  - Paper-based member records: Physical files containing member information, contracts, and payment history.
  - Excel spreadsheets: Used for tracking memberships, payments, and basic reporting.
  - Cash registers: Manual payment processing and receipt generation.
  - Physical appointment books: Handwritten schedules for trainers and services.
  - WhatsApp/Phone communication: For appointment booking and member queries.
  - Difficulty in maintaining records
  - Time-consuming
  - Editing the data is a very tedious job
  - No security of data
  - Mistakes occur in long calculations
  - No proper generation of reports
  - Lack of efficiency and manpower
  - High data redundancy
  - Data inconsistency

**Page 5: Improve on the issues and the problems of the system:-**

- IDENTIFY the problem: Inefficient member check-in, billing and payment challenges, appointment management issues, poor reporting and analytics, and limited member experience.
- DEFINE the main elements of the problem: Manual processes, data redundancy, error-prone operations, limited accessibility, and lack of real-time insights.
- EXAMINE possible solutions: Implement a comprehensive digital gym management system.
- ACT on resolving the problem: Develop Pulse Point Frontdesk using React, TypeScript, and Supabase.
- LOOK for lessons to learn: Continuous improvement through agile methodologies and user feedback.

**Page 6: DFD (Data Flow Diagram)**

Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of data flow in any system. It can illustrate incoming data flow, outgoing data flow and store data. Data flow diagram describes anything about how data flows through the system. Sometimes people get confused between data flow diagram and flowchart.

1. Provide a graphical tool. This can be used by the analyst to explain his understanding of the system to the user.
2. It can be readily converter into a structure chart which is used in design.

❖ DATA FLOW DIAGRAM ELEMENTS

A data flow diagram needs to be simple a user has to go through it, understand it and suggest correction or changes. A data flow diagram user only four elements.
❖ External entity
❖ Data flow
❖ Process
❖ Data store

**Page 7: External Entity**

**External Entity** – Also known as actors, sources or sinks, and terminators, external entities produce and consume data that flows between the entity and the system being diagrammed. These data flows are the inputs and outputs of the DFD. Since they are external to the system being analysed, these entities are typically placed at the boundaries of the diagram. They can represent another system or indicate a subsystem.

**Data Flow**: Movement of data between external entities, processes and data stores is represented with an arrow symbol, which indicates the direction of flow. This data could be electronic, written or verbal. Input and output data flows are labelled based on the type of data or its associated process or data store, and this name is written alongside the arrow.

**Process**: An activity that changes or transforms data flows. Since they transform incoming data to outgoing data, all processes must have inputs and outputs on a DFD. This symbol is given a simple name based on its function, such as “Ship Order,” rather than being labelled “process” on a diagram. In Gane-Sarson notation, a rectangular box is used and may be labelled with a reference number, location of where in the system the process occurs and a short title that describes its function. Processes are typically oriented from top to bottom and left to right on a flow diagram.

**Page 8: Data Store**

**Data Store**: Any store data but with no reference to the physical method of storing. There is a logical requirement for the data to be stored. It is held in data store; a data store therefore is a reposition of the data. It is represented by an open-ended rectangle. A number and a name and identify each data store.

**Functional decomposition:-**
A functional decomposition diagram contains the whole function or project along with all of the necessary sub-tasks needed to complete it.

Functional decomposition is a problem-solving tool used in several contexts, from business and industry to computer programming and AI.

**Page 9: Functional Decomposition Steps:-**

The process of functional decomposition can be broken down into several steps. The use of a functional decomposition diagram is key to this step.

1. Find the basic function: What is the basic task a device or process must accomplish?
2. List essential sub-functions: These sub-functions or sub-tasks are instrumental to the success of the basic function.
3. List the next tier of sub-functions: These sub-functions serve the upper-level sub-functions.
4. Inspect the diagram: If there are functions that have been omitted, add them to the diagram.

**Page 57: Conclusions**

**Page 58: Conclusions:-**

This is to conclude that the Pulse Point Frontdesk project was worked upon with a sincere effort. Most of the requirements have been fulfilled up to the mark and the requirements which have been remaining can be completed with a short extension. The system successfully addresses the critical challenges faced by traditional gym management, providing a comprehensive solution for member management, package and service administration, appointment scheduling, payment processing, and insightful reporting.

**Future enhancements:-**

> We can also add biometric integration for faster check-ins.
> Mobile applications can be developed for members to manage their profiles and book services.
> A dedicated trainer portal can be implemented to manage schedules and client progress.
> Automated marketing campaigns can be integrated for promotions and renewals.
> Multi-location support can be added for managing multiple gym branches.
> Advanced analytics can be incorporated for predictive insights.
> Third-party integrations with accounting software and fitness tracking devices can be added.
